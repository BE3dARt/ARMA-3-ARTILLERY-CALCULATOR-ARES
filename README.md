# Arma III ARES Artillery Calculator
##Introduction
ARES is a web service to calculate the elevation, heading, and fire mode needed to precisely hit a target in Arma III. Currently, it supports the artillery tanks 2S9 Sochor and M4 Scorcher. An addition to support the MAAWS Mk4 Mod 0 is on the way.

##How Does It Work
First off, do a right-click to add your artillery unit. By right-clicking anywhere on the map again, a target for your artillery unit is created. Hold the left mouse button to drag your placed markers around. Right-click on a marker to delete it. Note: Left-click is equivalent to one press on mobile / Right-click is equivalent to long-press on mobile

##Limitations
* Currently, only Altis is implemented.

##Download of Map Data
Unfortunately, the map tiles exceed the GitHub upload limit. I had to host them on my website. You can get them by following these steps:

1. Download the .zip file via http://be3dart.ch/download/map.zip
2. Unzip map.zip and drag-and-drop the map folder into the root project folder
